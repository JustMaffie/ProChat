Backend:

	Create an endpoint, probably /gateway or /gateway/v1 or smth like that, that will be a websocket connection
	Create an endpoint to register, supply username/password/email, this will return Username, Email and token (token the same as discord pretty much)
	Create an endpoint to log in, supply username/password or email/password, this will return Username, Email and token (token the same as discord pretty much)
	Create an endpoint to fetch all messages in a certain room
	Create an endpoint to post a message

Frontend:
	
	Make sure it works well with the api, supports multiple rooms, and possibly the entire client just in 1 app without any reloading, so if I'd go from the login to chat page, the page doesn't refresh
	Store the token in Local Storage
